### Professional Website Requirements

- **Color**
    - Color choices are used carefully to highlight important information.
    - If multiple colors are used, these colors are chosen with care so that the resulting visuals are clear and all elements are readable and are easy to look at.
    - Avoid using exclusively bright colors.  Not all page elements need to be something other than black or white.
- **Text & Font**
    - Written information is clear and grammatically correct
    - Font choice prioritizes readability
    - Font sizes and colors are appropriate and make the content easy to read
    - Important information is easily identified using text modifications (bold, italics, color change, etc)
- **Images & Resources**
    - Additional page elements (like images) add value to the page and are chosen thoughtfully
    - Images have a clear purpose and are positioned on the page in a meaningful way
    - Images have a proper alt text value
    - Images are properly stored and organized by page in the “resources” folder in the file tree
- **Links**
    - Clickable items (text links or images) are clearly identified
    - External resources are chosen thoughtfully and make sense in the context of the page
    - Internal page links allow the user to navigate throughout your website. Each internal page is organized in the “pages” folder in the file tree.
- **Inspect**
    - The console should not show any text or testing outputs. Users can have access to this information and it is not safe or professional for them to see it.
